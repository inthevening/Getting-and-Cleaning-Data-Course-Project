The run_analysis.R does the following.

1)Read the data from the user working directory. 
2)Renames the columns that we will need in the next steps. 
3)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
4)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set called "output" with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
